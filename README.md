This script should be run from the root folder for the UCI HAR Dataset

The dataset is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
and then extracted. The root extracted folder will contain several files and two subdirectories called "test" and "train."

The working directory in R should be set to the the root extracted folder such that "test" and "train" appear as subdirectories of the working directory.
